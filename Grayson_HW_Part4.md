#Grayson's Homework Part 4

##Class Aspirations: What I hope to get out of this class is the ability to understand and compute advanced computer functions in multiple forms to widen my possibilities when it comes to employment, recreation, or personal interests even such as entrepreneurship.
Also I've been somewhat infatuated with computers for some time now so learning more about how to perform new tasks on them is challenging and interesting.
